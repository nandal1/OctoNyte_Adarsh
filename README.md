A RISC-V Multithreaded Core Targeting the Skywater 0.13um ASIC library

**Story**  
As a **RISC-V Simulation Engineer**, I want to **co-simulate RTL implementations** alongside **Spike** (the official RISC-V ISA simulator) so that I can confirm functional correctness, detect potential mismatches between the hardware design and the reference model, and optimize performance and design parameters before final tape-out.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Spike & RTL Co-Simulation Setup**  
   - **Condition:** There must be a framework that allows cycle-by-cycle or transaction-level comparison between the RTL signals and Spike’s reference state (registers, memory).  
   - **Test:** Running a set of instructions or a full program in the co-simulation environment should produce matching results between RTL and Spike at all relevant checkpoints.  
   - **Satisfaction:** No mismatches occur for validated instructions and memory transactions under normal operating conditions.

2. **ISA Compliance & Extensions**  
   - **Condition:** Co-simulation must handle various RISC-V ISA extensions (M, A, F, D, etc.) consistently.  
   - **Test:** The system runs the official RISC-V compliance suite in co-simulation mode, checking that each instruction in the extended sets behaves identically in both the RTL and Spike.  
   - **Satisfaction:** All compliance tests pass (or mismatches are flagged and diagnosed).

3. **Scalability & Performance**  
   - **Condition:** The co-simulation environment should handle larger test programs (e.g., Linux boot, SPEC benchmarks) without prohibitive runtime.  
   - **Test:** Testing a moderately sized benchmark (e.g., CoreMark or a basic Linux environment) completes in under a target timeframe (e.g., 2 hours).  
   - **Satisfaction:** Simulation performance is acceptable for iterative development, and major performance bottlenecks are documented or mitigated.

4. **Analysis & Reporting**  
   - **Condition:** The environment must generate detailed logs and summaries for debug and performance analysis.  
   - **Test:** When mismatches occur (e.g., register states differ), the system logs the offending instruction and context (PC, register values, time).  
   - **Satisfaction:** Engineers can quickly locate and diagnose the source of mismatches or performance anomalies; logs are exportable (JSON, CSV) for deeper analysis.

5. **Validation & Accuracy**  
   - **Condition:** Co-simulation results must be validated against known hardware data or performance metrics.  
   - **Test:** Compare the final architectural state (register contents, memory values) and cycle counts (if feasible) against real hardware or established reference data.  
   - **Satisfaction:** Results match or deviate within an acceptable threshold (e.g., <1% for performance counters).

6. **User Feedback & Parameter Changes**  
   - **Condition:** Engineers should easily enable or disable RISC-V extensions, alter memory configurations, or modify design features in the RTL or Spike.  
   - **Test:** Changing a parameter (e.g., memory size, adding the “M” extension) should not break the co-simulation setup; both models reflect the new parameters seamlessly.  
   - **Satisfaction:** Configuration changes propagate smoothly with minimal manual intervention, and re-simulations run without major disruptions.

### **Definition of Done**

1. **Functional Requirements**  
   - Accurate RISC-V co-simulation at both the instruction and transactional levels.  
   - Ability to run official compliance tests and custom test suites for extended instructions.  
   - Automatic detection of state mismatches between the RTL and Spike.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**  
   - Co-simulation remains performant enough for iterative regression testing (e.g., overnight runs for moderate test suites).  
   - Secure handling of design files, ensuring no data corruption or unauthorized access to proprietary RTL code.

3. **Testing & Validation**  
   - The RISC-V compliance suite passes for each targeted extension in co-simulation mode.  
   - Reference benchmarks confirm the correctness and performance alignment of the RTL design with Spike.  
   - Mismatch logs are automatically generated with sufficient detail for swift debug.

4. **Documentation**  
   - Comprehensive user guides explain how to configure, run, and troubleshoot co-simulation scenarios.  
   - Clear instructions on analyzing logs, stepping through mismatches, and extending the environment for custom instructions.
